            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>

            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
                system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The
                prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual
                objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types
                are not explicitly typed.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
            <header>Hello World</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <code>
                <pre>function greetMe(yourName) {alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");</pre>
            </code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
                
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

            <ul>
                <!-- add something here, idk what to add so yeahh... -->
                <li>Insert Value</li>
                <li>Insert Value</li>
                <li>Insert Value</li>
                <li>Insert Value</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_Variables">
            <header>Declaring Variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    var x = 42.</pre>
            </code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    x = 42.</pre>
            </code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
            With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    let y = 13.</pre>
            </code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>

            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    if (true) { 
                        var x = 5; 
                    } 
                    console.log(x); // 5</pre>
            </code>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
            <code>
                <pre>
                    if (true) {
                        let y = 5; 
                    } 
                    console.log(y); 
                    // ReferenceError: y is not defined</pre>
            </code>
            <p>i don't know.</p>
